# 🔌 EV Charging Demand Forecasting – Week 3 (AICTE Internship)

This repository contains the Week 3 implementation for the **EV Charging Demand Forecasting** project under the **AICTE Internship Cycle 2 (S4F)**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The project aims to predict the charging demand for electric vehicles (EVs) based on regional registration data. It leverages data analysis, preprocessing, machine learning models, and deployment techniques to offer a practical solution to increasing EV demand.

## 🔍 Week 3 Additions

- Cleaned and preprocessed the original EV dataset.
- Trained a predictive model to forecast charging sessions using **Linear Regression**.
- Exported the trained model as a `.pkl` file.
- Created a separate `.csv/.xlsx` file with cleaned data for future use.
- Prepared PowerPoint Presentation summarizing the entire work with graphs and screenshots.

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (missing values, column selection)
2. Visualization and correlation check
3. Feature selection (e.g., number of EVs registered)
4. Model training using `scikit-learn`
5. Evaluation using **R² Score**
6. Model saving with `pickle`
7. PPT preparation with summary, screenshots & solution
